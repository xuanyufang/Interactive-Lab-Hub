# Project Handover 

## Idea Formation

### Idea Generation

Our original idea was initially inspired by this clip from a Netflix show *Space Force*.

During the age of pandemic, our device was then inspired by the increasing prevalence of virtual meetings. In the recent years, more and more first encounters between people occurred through a video conference or zoom meeting instead of actual presenting in a physical space. A remote handshaking device would be a art-oriented, but symbolic project that reflects the society's needs. As the technical details being set, this could also have potential practical usage as products that would allow people to perform delicate but dangerous tasks remotely like defusing a bomb, or operate a surgery if physical present is not avaliable. 

### Sketch

Here is our sketch of the device:

### Technical detail Set-Up

After completing the device design, we started with testing some basic technical details to ensure the idea is achivable, here's the video record of our first attempt to communicate over Pi and control motors from the other side using joysticks over MQTT server. This set up the basic ideas of how are we going to remotely control the hand.
